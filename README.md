Pechkin
=======

.NET Wrapper for [WkHtmlToPdf](http://github.com/antialize/wkhtmltopdf) DLL, a library that uses the Webkit engine to convert HTML pages to PDF. This fork supports .NET 2.0 and up and *now runs in both 64 and 32-bit environments*!

NOTE: 
Azure does not play nice with wkhtmltox.dll because it uses the GDI libraries. 
See: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsazure/en-US/eb48e701-8c0b-4be3-b694-2e11cc6ff2e1/wkhtmltopdf-in-windows-azure?forum=windowsazurewebsitespreview

New in 0.9.3
------
The unmanaged DLLs that Pechkin depends upon have been packaged as *embedded resources* so you don't have to worry about messing around with pre- or post-build events to copy the files wherever they go in your solution. When the library is first accessed in the application lifetime, it will copy the embedded resources to a temporary directory (if they do not exist there already) and invoke WinApi to load them up.

The dependencies now consist of just wkhtmltox.dll (in both the 32-bit and 64-bit builds for Windows).

TuesPechkin 0.9.3 is also available as a *NuGet package* (see: https://www.nuget.org/packages/TuesPechkin/) for your convenience.

If you experience any problems using TuesPechkin, please be sure to create the issues on TuesPechkin and not the original Pechkin branch. I am so grateful to gmanny for his contribution but at this point I see the codebase evolving further away from the original and I would like to continue to support it for you (and myself! ;))


FAQ
---

### Q: Why does the produced PDF lack background images and colors? ###

**A:** By default, all backgrounds will be omitted from the document (note: this is similar to how Google Chrome operates when printing to PDF.)

You can override this setting by calling `SetPrintBackground(true)` on the `ObjectConfig` supplied with the HTML document to the `Convert()` method of the converter.

### Q: Do I need to install wkhtmltopdf on the machine for the library to work? ###

**A:** No. Version 0.12 of wkhtmltox.dll is embedded into the package and unpacked on library initialization.

### Q: Why is my website or application locking up when using TuesPechkin?

**A:** If you do not dispose of the IPechkin object properly, the converter will not be properly 'cleaned up' and so the next time you create and run a converter, the wkhtmltox.dll library will hang up. Be sure to dispose of your IPechkin objects every time!

Usage
-----

Pechkin is both easy to use....

```csharp
String html = "<html><body><h1>Hello world!</h1></body></html>";

using (var converter = Factory.Create(new GlobalConfig()))
{
    byte[] pdfBuf = converter.Convert(html);
}
```

...and functional:

```csharp
// create global configuration object
GlobalConfig gc = new GlobalConfig();

// set it up using fluent notation
gc.SetMargins(new Margins(300, 100, 150, 100))
  .SetDocumentTitle("Test document")
  .SetPaperSize(PaperKind.Letter);
//... etc

// create converter
IPechkin pechkin = Factory.Create(gc);

// subscribe to events
pechkin.Begin += OnBegin;
pechkin.Error += OnError;
pechkin.Warning += OnWarning;
pechkin.PhaseChanged += OnPhase;
pechkin.ProgressChanged += OnProgress;
pechkin.Finished += OnFinished;

// create document configuration object
ObjectConfig oc = new ObjectConfig();

// and set it up using fluent notation too
oc.SetCreateExternalLinks(false)
  .SetFallbackEncoding(Encoding.ASCII)
  .SetLoadImages(false)
  .SetPageUri("http://google.com");
//... etc

// convert document
byte[] pdfBuf = pechkin.Convert(oc);

// Be sure to dispose! Preferably with a using statement.
pechkin.Dispose();
```
